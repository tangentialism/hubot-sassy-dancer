==================

That thing where there's a sassy dancer in Twitter who says things, but for Hubot.

## Installation

Put it in your `scripts` folder, homey.

## Usage

Tell your robot to "sass me" a three-word phrase:

`robot sass me like he said`

```
(•_•)
<) )╯   like
 / \

 (•_•)
\( (>   he
 / \

(•_•)
<) )╯   said 
 / \
```

...or a three-part phrase, delimited by some sweet forward-slashes:

`robot sass me Blowing from the west / Fallen leaves gather / In the east.`

```
(•_•)
<) )╯   Blowing from the west
 / \

 (•_•)
\( (>   Fallen leaves gather
 / \

(•_•)
<) )╯   In the east. 
 / \
 ```

 Yep. That's all I got.
